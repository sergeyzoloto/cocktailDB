# cocktailDB
API module single page app

A Single Page Application interacts with TheCocktailDB API and contains the following routes:
- Homepage. Displays a welcome intro, a search string, and a button “I’m feeling lucky” returning a random cocktail.
- Results page. When a user stops typing, a result list containing drink and ingredient options appears below the search string. Clicking on a cocktail opens a recipe page. Clicking on an ingredient adds filtering.
- Recipe page. Contains a drink image, short info, tags, ingredients, and instructions.
